## What?

Minimal Vagrant environment for testing the current production/supported releases of:

 - CentOS
 - Ubuntu
 - Debian

Nothing much to see here. GitHub as file storage ftw!

## How?

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
1. Clone this repository somewhere.
1. `vagrant status`
1. `vagrant up <vm-name>` where `<vm-name>` is replaced with the name of the VM you wish to boot, from the list generated in the previous step.
1. Modify to your needs.
