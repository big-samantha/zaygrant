## What?

Minimal Vagrant environment for testing the current production/supported releases of:

 - CentOS
 - Ubuntu
 - Debian

Nothing much to see here. GitHub as file storage ftw!

## How?

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
1. Clone this repository somewhere.
1. `vagrant status`
1. `vagrant up <vm-name>` where `<vm-name>` is replaced with the name of the VM you wish to boot, from the list generated in the previous step.
1. Modify to your needs.

The above steps should be enough to get started for anybody running Mac OS X or Linux on their workstation.

For Windows, there are many useful tutorials on [the internet](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=vagrant%20windows%20host). Google link provided not to be obnoxious, but to avoid giving a link to soon-to-be-dated instructions.
